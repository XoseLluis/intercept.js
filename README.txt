Intercept.js

function (method) interception and property interception (ECMAScript 5 properties) for JavaScript.

intercept-2.0.js is the last version and the one you should be interested in.

The previous intercept.js uses a different "usage approach", it's based on providing beforeGet-afterGet, beforeSet-afterSet function pairs, which make the logic for these functions much more complex.
